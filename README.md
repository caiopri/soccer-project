**Introduction**

In this project I analyzed some data on European Soccer Leagues between 2008 and 2016. 
The database is available in the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). It includes information on more than 25,000 matches and 10,000 players in 11 European Countries' lead championship. It also includes data on Players and Teams' attributes from the EA Sports FIFA video game series.

**Data Analysis**

The questions explored in this project are:
- Which league has the highest average number of goals per match?
- Is there a home team advantage? In other words, do teams that play at home win more games?
- Which players improved their overall rating the most during the period?
- Is there a correlation between a player's height and his overall rating?
- Do players with a specific preferred foot have a higher overall rating?
- Which team attributes are associated with more victories?
